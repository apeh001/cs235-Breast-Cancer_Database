# cs235-Breast-Cancer_Database

## Project Description

In this project, my teammate and I took a number of data mining techniques and implemented and applied to a real-world imbalanced dataset. The dataset used is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. This project was split into two different parts: unsupervised and supervised. For the supervised learning portion, we first divided up the data into the features and the target data. We then created our own classifiers to test the data with: Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. We then used these classifiers to use in SVD, feature selection, and SMOTE. After this phase, our second phase was using unsupervised techniques. We created our KMeans and KMeans++, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, and Isolation Forest on our own, and used the same dataset to implement these.
